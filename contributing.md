## What counts as awesome-earth-system-ml dataset?
- The list is aimed to facilitate humans who aim to develop *algorithms*. 
- We have excluded data products, i.e., algorithm-based predictions, for now because they would be used in less obvious ways, e.g., semi-supervised labeling.

## Guideline

- We'd appreciate entries in the form of :
```
- [**Name**](link.com) *(list_of_authors, years_available)* \
A <task> dataset from <location> with <size> <object> with <features>.

```
- The description reads best if it's concise and short.
- Feel free to add a section if needed.
  - Remember to add the section title to Table of Contents.
- Make sure spelling and grammar sits.
- Remove trailing whitespaces.
